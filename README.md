###How to get up and running with development

After cloning the repo, `cd` into it and run the following:

`$ npm install`

After the necessary modules have been installed, use the following command to watch your files:

`$ npm run watch`

The only thing left to do now, is to start a server, e.g. Pythons simple HTTP server:

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Now visit `localhost:8000/app/` in your browser and you will see the index page.
